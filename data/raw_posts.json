If I have to compare this stats with YouTube, it took me years and years to achieve this.\n\nMy Initial thoughts:\n- Tiktok is for entertainment only.\n- Algorithm always recommend dance music videos\n- No proper audiences for my niche.\n\nMy current thoughts:\n- Algorithm always recommends on what you click and give more priority to; now my feed has spirituality, astrology, entrepreneurship shorts only.\n- Yes there are lot of audiences of all niches; It totally depends upon the content creator how much quality one can drive through video and how one can cater to all the audiences.\n- Also over the time, tiktok had also always given video reach, which it deserved; which YouTube didn't give!\n\nSo, my advice for starters would be Tiktok as first choice to market or share things.\nTo add, in context of Nepal or be it of USA, there is no assurance of Tiktok; it might get banned or removed any time; but during Tiktok time, one can also redirect Tiktok audiences to YouTube or other platforms; which might save content creator from upcoming wrong happenings!!",
